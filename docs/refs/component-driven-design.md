> Learn how Uber, Pinterest, Shopify and Airbnb are leveraging components to build a consistent UI/UX design system.
  
 - Visual and functional consistency
 - Why
    - Reusability encourages consistency for both UI and UX as components create a consistent experience wherever they’re used.
    - Atomic Design can be leveraged for better consistency as larger components are composed out of smaller components, reducing unexpected and disjoint experiences.
    - Components provide better collaboration between design and development, allowing your design language to evolve over time. Ideally, what you see on Sketch is what you build with React.
    - Design aspects such as typefaces, typography, primary and secondary colors can still be specified as part of the component design system.
