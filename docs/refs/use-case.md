> As you already found, a single use case has typically a broader scope than a single user story because it tries to completely describe a user interaction including errors and deviations from the normal path. A user story can be roughly compared to a single flow through a use case
  
单个 usecase 通常比单个用户故事更具有广泛的范围，因为它试图完全描述用户交互，包括错误和与正常路径的偏差。而用户故事可以粗略地与通过用例的单个流进行比较。
